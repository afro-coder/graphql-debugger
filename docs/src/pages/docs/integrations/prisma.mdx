# Connecting GraphQL Debugger to Prisma

GraphQL Debugger generates [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) compatible spans, and so does [Prisma Tracing](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/observability-and-logging/opentelemetry-tracing), therefore it is possible to connect the two together.

> Note Prisma Traces will be marked as `forigen` spans, as they are not part of the GraphQL request.

### Prisma Tracing

To enable Prisma Tracing you first need to change the `prisma.schema` file to include the tracing preview feature:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["tracing"] // <-- add this line
}
```

Then you can pass in the [`PrismaInstrumentation`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/instrumentation) to the `traceSchema` method:

```ts
import { traceSchema } from "@graphql-debugger/trace-schema";

import { PrismaInstrumentation } from "@prisma/instrumentation";

const tracedSchema = traceSchema({
  schema,
  instrumentations: [new PrismaInstrumentation()],
});
```

Doing so will allow you to see each Prisma request that happens inside your resolvers.
