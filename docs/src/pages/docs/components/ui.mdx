# GraphQL Debugger UI

The UI is a React application that visualizes the traces stored in the database. It contains a dashboard that shows the traces and spans, and a trace viewer that shows the trace details. It communicates with [The Backend](/docs/components/backend) via [The GraphQL Schema](/docs/packages/graphql-schema) using the [The Client](/docs/packages/client).

## Getting Started

The best way to get started with the UI is to run the [The CLI](/docs/packages/cli) and follow the instructions. The CLI will guide you through the process of setting up the UI and the backend.

```bash
npx graphql-debugger
```

Then visiting [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686) will show the UI.
