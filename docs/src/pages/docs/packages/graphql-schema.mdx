# @graphql-debugger/graphql-schema

You can build your own Proxy [Adapter](/docs/components/adapters) using this GraphQL Schema.

## Usage

The example below will import the `createServer` function and then start a proxy to your adapter as the client is injected into the server.

```js
import { createServer } from '@graphql-debugger/graphql-schema';
import { Adapter } from "@graphql-debugger/adapter__YOUR_ADAPTER__";
import { DebuggerClient } from "@graphql-debugger/client";
import express, { Express } from "express";

const adapter = new Adapter();
const client = new DebuggerClient({
    adapter
});

const server = createServer({
    adapter,
    client
});

const app = express();
app.use(
    "/graphql",
    createServer({
        // here the client is injected into the server
        client,
    }),
);

const server = await app.listen(16686);
```

This essentally means that if you create your own storage adapter, you can use this schema to build your own GraphQL API and self host GraphQL Debugger.
