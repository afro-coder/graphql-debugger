# graphql-debugger CLI

The GraphQL Debugger CLI spawns [The Backend](/docs/components/backend) and [The Collector](/docs/components/collector) using a SQLite [Adapter](/docs/components/adapters). Its really easy to get started, by running the command below:

```sh
npx graphql-debugger

# Collector Online, send traces to http://localhost:4318/v1/traces.

# Debugger Online, visit http://localhost:16686 to view traces.
```

## Configure Ports

Use the environment variables below to configure the ports used by the CLI:

```sh
COLLECTOR_PORT=4318 BACKEND_PORT=16686 npx graphql-debugger
```

## Pin a Version

To pin a version of the CLI, you should install GraphQL Debugger as a dependency and then run debugger from a script

Install from NPM:

```
npm install graphql-debugger@VERSION
```

Add script to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "gql-debugger": "graphql-debugger"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "graphql-debugger": "@VERSION"
  }
}
```

Run the script:

```sh
npm run gql-debugger

# Collector Online, send traces to http://localhost:4318/v1/traces.

# Debugger Online, visit http://localhost:16686 to view traces.
```
